        <h2 class="text--center">API</h2>

        <p class="lede"></p>
            <h3>1. Static file server</h3>
            <p>Let's say you have a website with the following files:</p>
    </div>
            <div class="code-sample">

            <pre><code>- index.html
-- css/style.css
-- js/jquery.min.js</code></pre>
            </div>
    <div class="container">

            <p>... and you want to test it on multiple devices. That's really easy! Just create a file
            at the same level as your <code>index.html</code> called something like <strong><code>bs.js</code></strong>
            and enter the following: </p>

    </div>
            <div class="code-sample">

            {% highlight javascript %}
                {% include scripts/api/init.js %}
            {% endhighlight %}
                </div>

    <div class="container">
            <p>Save that file (<strong>bs.js</strong>) and then in the same directory, just run the following command:</p>
    </div>
            <div class="code-sample">

            {% highlight bash %}
$ node bs.js
            {% endhighlight %}

                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>That will start the BrowserSync server & open up a browser tab for you at something like <code>localhost:3000</code>. That
                    address will work in all browsers on your current machine - but if you want to test on external devices, then you'll
                    need the second address that was printed to the console when you ran the previous command.</p>

                    <p>You should see something along these lines in your console/terminal:</p>
                </div>
    <div class="code-sample">
    {% highlight bash %}
$ [BS] Local: >>> http://localhost:3000
$ [BS] External: >>> http://192.168.0.4:3000
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
