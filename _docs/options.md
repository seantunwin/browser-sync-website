These are all the options that you can configure when using BrowserSync. Create a single object and pass 
it as the [first argument](/docs/api/#api-browserSync) (for GulpJS and normal API usage). If you're using Grunt, you can 
still use all of these options, but you need to provide them as detailed in the [BrowserSync Grunt Documentation]({{site.links.grunt}})
